1- Run App(remember that javascript shopuld be on at your browser)
2- For access to API page you have to change statusbar to: 
		Yourserver:port/apipath
3- In "Search Paths By Station Name(API)" link we don't have respond because for test app you need at least insert
	 two parameters(Original and Destination Station)
		- we have four parameters: Original,Destination,Via1 and Via2 Station.
		- two parameters are obligatory (Original(o) and Destination(d)
		- two parameters are optional (Via1(v1) and Via2(v2)
4- for test api you could use this query string:
		Yourserver:port/apipath?o=ABBADIA%20LARIANA&d=ABBIATEGRASSO
